## add quickly free course on udemy account

I realized this script with nodejs and selenium.
I created this program because I had several free course offered for udemy and I had the laziness to grab them by hand. I wrote all the urls of the free courses in one file. Then I realized this script that reads the file and adds each of the file's courses to my udemy account.
You can see file example in examplefile.txt.

At first, I realized this only for my personal use then I think that it would be cool to share it with others.

## Functionality
 - asks the user for the required information
 - login with email and password
 - read the specified file
 - browse all the links in the file
 - very quickly (few second for each course)
 - If the course is free, it adds it to the udemy account
 - goes to the next if the course is already added or is paying
 - work with udemy into different language
 - compatible with nodejs >= 4

## Install
```
npm install -g add-free-course-udemy
```
